# Triangle_Tesselation_P5js
Practice making contributions to code hosted by another user. 

Here you will make contributions to the code in the following way: 

1. "Fork" the repository. This makes a copy of the repository with you as the owner. It is linked to the orignal, in that changes made can be pulled by the orignal owner.
2. Create changes to your code to add in your triangles. Test out the code in p5js, then copy your edits to the sketch.js file that is in the repository.
3. Commit your changes. Write an appropriate commit message to describe them.
4. Create a pull request. This gives the original owner the opportunity to merge your changes with the original.
5. The original owner will merge your changes, adding them to the code and combining with other contributors' work. :)


Here is the image that we will be creating. Decide with your classmates which color triangles you will produce.
